## Planning

- I'm using this for random ideas/notes, probably going to pseudocode here as well.

## General notes

- What elements do I need in HTML?
    - H1 for name of page, right now "Simon says... Rock out!" but that may be the begin message
    - Div for message display beneath tab but above guitar
    - 4 buttons housed in a span or container?
    - Beneath this I need a div that keeps track of what round you're on
    - Beneath this I need a div that keeps track of the total moves of the current round
    - ADD THE DIV FOR HIGH SCORE LAST, WHO KNOWS IF I GET THAT FAR

- Initial CSS
    - Make buttons glow on hover
    - Make a more intense glow upon click, use same glow for computer selection
